To find the entity manager in the client 1.12.1, I just search for the string
"object manager" in IDA and that took me to a function that did use the object
manager to print some information to the console, from there I was able to
retrive the offsets. Since this function wrote to the console I was also able
to get the ConsoleWrite and ConsoleWriteA functions that write a colored
message to the console.

I had some problems using the ConsoleWriteA function to write formatted strings,
so I searched another wow's binary with debug info for a nicer function, and saw
ConsolePrintf that works just like the c standard library's printf. To find the
address in the 1.12.1 binary I just searched from a call that both binaries did
using the same string argument.
