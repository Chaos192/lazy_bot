A automation tool to play World of Warcraft for me
![](demo3.gif)
## Why?
I thought it would be a fun little project, I don't even play the game.

## How it works?
The bot works by injecting a dll into the game's client, directly calling game's functions and accessing its data structures in memory.

## Building
Don't. It is not usable yet.
